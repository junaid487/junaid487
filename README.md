## 🛠 Tech Stack

### **AI & Machine Learning**
- **Core ML:** Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Scikit-learn, Feature Engineering.
- **GenAI (In Progress):** Prompt Engineering, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LLM integration.
- **Deep Learning:** Understanding of Neural Networks and Transformer architectures.

### **Data Analysis & Visualization**
- **Data:** Python (NumPy, Pandas), SQL (Foundational).
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (Interactive Dashboards).
- **Imbalanced Data:** Expertise in SMOTE and cost-sensitive learning.

### **Development & Deployment**
- **Frameworks:** Streamlit (Rapid Prototyping), Flask.
- **Tools:** Git/GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter, Linux Basics.

## 🧠 My Approach

- **Model to System:** I don't just train models; I build interfaces (Streamlit) to make data accessible.
- **Reproducibility:** I prioritize modular code and environment management to ensure experiments are repeatable.
- **Continuous Evolution:** Actively transitioning from classical ML to the Generative AI stack (LLMs, Vector Databases).
