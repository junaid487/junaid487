# Hi, I'm Junaid Alam 👋

**Aspiring Data Scientist & ML Engineer** I bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights. My focus is on building **end-to-end ML pipelines** with an emphasis on **clean code, reproducibility, and practical systems.**

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🏆 [Project Name - e.g., Credit Scoring System]
*A brief one-sentence description of what the project achieves (e.g., Predicting loan defaults using ensemble learning).*

- **Key Tech:** Python, Scikit-Learn, SMOTE, Streamlit.
- **The Problem:** Handled highly imbalanced data where 95% of cases were "Non-Defaults."
- **The Solution:** Implemented SMOTE for oversampling and optimized a Random Forest model to prioritize Recall.

## 🧠 My Approach

- **Why over How:** I don’t just import libraries; I focus on understanding the underlying mathematics of algorithms.
- **Production-Ready:** I strive to write modular code that is ready for deployment, not just one-off notebooks.
- **End-to-End:** My workflow covers everything from raw data ingestion to interactive dashboards.
